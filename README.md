# Welcome to OSINT Framework

The **OSINT framework** was designed to collect data using open-source technologies and resources. The goal is to assist users in locating free **OSINT** resources. You should be able to access at least some of the material for free, while some of the linked websites may ask for registration or charge for additional data.
This paradigm was initially developed from an information security perspective. The response from all disciplines and fields has been amazing ever since. If there are any more OSINT resources available, particularly from fields other than information security, please let me know. Tell me about anything you think might be missing, please!
Kindly click the following link to view the framework, and happy hunting!
